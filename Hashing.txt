#Hashing Tools

Automated hash recognition tools like https://pypi.org/project/hashID/ exist, but they are unreliable for many formats.

On Linux, password hashes are stored in /etc/shadow. This file is normally only readable by root.

On Windows, password hashes are stored in the SAM. Windows tries to prevent normal users from dumping them, but tools like mimikatz exist for this. Importantly, the hashes found there are split into NT hashes and LM hashes.

To find more hash formats and password prefixes is the hashcat example page, available here: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes.

NTLM:
You can acquire NTHash/NTLM hashes by dumping the SAM database on a Windows machine, by using a tool like Mimikatz 
or from the Active Directory database: NTDS.dit. You may not have to crack the hash to continue privilege escalation- 
as you can often conduct a "pass the hash" attack instead, but sometimes hash cracking is a viable option if there is a weak password policy.
